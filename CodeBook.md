#### This code book describes the variables, data, and transformations performed to clean up the raw dataset and create a new tidy table.

 
## Data Set Information

The data for this project: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto (Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory, DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova, Genoa, Italy).

Linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone (link below):

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.


### The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

## Study Design
               
system          x86_64, mingw32  
version.string  R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02)

### Method

- Downloaded FUCI_HAR data from internet to local machine 
- Created R script run_analysis.R to perform the following tasks 
	* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
- Created tidy data table newTidyDataUCIHAR.txt:
	* resulting from R script run_analysis.R performed on HAR_USD data
	* variables are descriptive, unique, no underscore or dots or white spaces
	* variables with characters made into factors and descriptive
	* a variable on each column (tall table)
	* added column for type of type of experiment (train or test)
